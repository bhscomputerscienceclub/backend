# Coulomb-backend

To start developing
1. run `make init` to initialize the venv and stuff
2. run `make debug` to run the server
  * you can go to <http://localhost:8000/docs> (or wherever the server is running) to see api docs

## Note:
* after adding any dependency run `make freeze` to add it to requirements.txt for everyone
* Formatter: <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/editor_integration.html>
